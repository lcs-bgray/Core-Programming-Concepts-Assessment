 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**

// Answer question 4 below
var appAmountUsed = 5
print("Used integer type because the amount of apps used will always be a whole number.")
var hoursOnPhone = 3.0
print("Used double type because the amount of hours on phone could be non-whole amouts such as 0.1-0.9")
var mostPopularApp = "YouTube"
print("Used string type because app names will be represented in text form.")
var currentDate = "Thursday, January 18, 2018"
print("Used string type because the date will be represented in text form.")
